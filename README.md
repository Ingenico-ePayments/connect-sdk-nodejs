# Ingenico Connect Node.js SDK

## Introduction

The Node.js SDK helps you to communicate with the [Ingenico Connect](http://www.ingenico.com/epayments) Server API. It's primary features are:

* convenient JavaScript wrapper around the API calls,
* authentication of all calls
* logging support by proxying log calls to a custom user defined logger instance
* validation of input and
* a logfile obfuscater

See the [Ingenico ePayments Developer Hub](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/server/nodejs/) for more information on how to use the API.
